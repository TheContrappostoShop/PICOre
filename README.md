# PICOre
The PICOre project consist of an ecosystem with stamp modules all pin to pin compatible.
This project and product will give you the opportunity to save you time in PCB design and assembly.
No need to copy and paste parts of previous design just to have the microcontroller part right.
Just drop the picore into your design and that it !

The PICOre has the necessary USB protections so you will just need to put a USB connector on your project if you wish with differential trace for D+ and D-.
The GND and AGND are both connected on the PICOre module using star grounding technic so if you need it on your PCB they can stay completely separated.
The Analog Vref is floating so if you need it you have the choice to connect it with the internal LDO or hook your own vref chip on your design for better result.

#RP2040 version
The RP2040 version has all the 30 standard GPIOs you will find on a standard pico. Don't forget to follow the GPIO numbers because all of the others will are not used.
