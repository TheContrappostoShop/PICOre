#KICAD LIBRARY

Those are the file you will need if you want to use the PICOre (of any version) into your PCB project. Make sure to use and connect pins that are available and not any of them.
For exemple the RP2040 version has 30 GPIOs so all the other will not be connected.

There is 3 footprint you can choose. Use the **THT** version if you want to have access to the USB and SWD pin under you PCB and use the **SMD** version if you want BGA style solder joints.
The PCB footprint is for those who wants to create their owm pcb version.
